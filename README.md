# Ojas-Python-Final-Project
My final project for programming for digital arts
This code will open up a gui where you can type in a city and get the current weather
Using the weather data, the gui will also pop up outfit suggestions, a possible activity, and will suggest what to eat
the gui also asks for an API, it doesn't need one listed as there is already one built into the code, but in the case of the built in api being taken down
one can use their own api_key that they can get from a free account on OpenWeatherMap
