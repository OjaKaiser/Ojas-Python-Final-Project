1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it's relevant to media and digital arts. 

This code will check the weather in your area and, using that data, suggest what to wear, meals to eat, and activities for the day. 

  

## Features 

- Feature 1: Checking the weather in your area 

	- The code will check a free weather API and, using your location, inform you about expected weather conditions, including temperature and precipitation. 

  

- Feature 2: Suggesting what to wear and possible accessories 

	- Using the weather information, the program will suggest different outfits randomly, narrowed down by the current weather.

	- Based on the weather, the program will select different foods from lists to plan three meals and a drink for the day. 

  

- Feature 4: Location-based activity suggestions 

	- Similar to Feature 3, the program aims to search for activities related to your location if possible. 

  

## Challenges 

- Learning how to make the program access a URL or API to gather weather data. 

- Learning how to incorporate the user's location into the program. 

- Developing an interface to control actions and display results. 

  

## Outcomes
